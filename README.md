#### Fundamental period of 1 signal
Write the signal in the form:
```
sin(𝑤𝑡) = sin(2𝜋𝑓𝑡) = sin(2𝜋𝑡/𝑇)
```
#### Fundamental period of 2 signals
The fundamental frequency of a signal is the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all the frequency components contained in a signal and equivalently

The fundamental period is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all individual periods of the components.

1. Determine fundamental period of inviduals signals
2. Find the ratio of fundamental period of 1st signal to fundamental period of every other signal
3. If the ratio's are RATIONAL, the composite signal is periodic. If the signal is not periodic there is no fundamental period.
   f0 = GCD(f1, f2, f3...)
   T0 = 1/f0
